		<img src="images/ben.jpg">
		<p>Some of Dr. Carson’s career highlights include the first successful separation of craniopagus (Siamese) twins joined at the back of the head in 1987, the first completely successful separation of type-2 vertical craniopagus twins in 1997 in South Africa, and the first successful placement of an intrauterine shunt for a hydrocephalic twin.</p>

		<h4>Ted Cruz</h4>
		<img src="images/ted.jpg">
		<p>As Solicitor General for the State of Texas and in private practice, Ted authored more than 80 U.S. Supreme Court briefs and argued 43 oral arguments, including nine before the U.S. Supreme Court, and has won an unprecedented series of landmark national victories including defending U.S. sovereignty against the UN and the World Court in Medellin v. Texas, defending our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms, defending the constitutionality of the Ten Commandments monument at the Texas State Capitol and the words “under God” in the Pledge of Allegiance.</p>

	<div class="candidate">
		<h4>John Kasich</h4>
		<img src="images/john.jpg">
		<p>Husband, father, friend, person of faith, leader, change agent. . . John Kasich is a lot of things.  Through them all runs his honest, direct, authentic, tenacious approach to life that has allowed him, time and again, to do what they said couldn’t be done and, as his mom told him as a boy, “make things a little better because you were there.”</p>

	<div class="candidate">
		<h4>Marco Rubio</h4>
		<img src="images/marco.jpg">
		</p>As a U.S. Senator, Marco has led a bold offensive to institute innovative, conservative ideas to address these fundamental issues and to restore hope in the American Dream. His ideas are firmly rooted in this simple truth — the American economy has changed significantly in recent decades and our policies must change with it.</p>
